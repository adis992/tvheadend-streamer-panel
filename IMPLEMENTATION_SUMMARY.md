# Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. GPU Load Monitoring in Header
- Added real-time GPU utilization cards in the main header
- Shows GPU usage %, memory %, and temperature
- Supports multiple GPUs (both AMD and NVIDIA)
- Updates every 3 seconds with live data
- Color-coded indicators (green < 50%, yellow 50-80%, red > 80%)

### 2. Channel Resolution Detection
- Automatic resolution detection using ffprobe
- Displays resolution (e.g., "1920x1080 (FHD)")
- Shows codec information (H.264, HEVC, etc.)
- Shows framerate when available
- Graceful fallback for streams that can't be probed

### 3. Multi-GPU Support
- Enhanced GPU detection for multiple AMD RX580 GPUs  
- Individual GPU monitoring and load balancing
- Support for mixed NVIDIA/AMD configurations
- Real-time utilization tracking per GPU

### 4. Docker Improvements
- Updated Dockerfile with better GPU support
- Enhanced docker-compose.yml for multi-GPU setups
- Added support for /dev/nvidia1, /dev/kfd, etc.
- Better privilege handling for GPU access

### 5. Documentation Consolidation
- Single comprehensive README.md
- Removed QUICKSTART.md and FINAL_STATUS_COMPLETE.md
- Added complete Docker deployment guide
- Included troubleshooting for multi-GPU setups
- Added performance tuning section

### 6. FFmpeg Profiles
- Created proper ffmpeg-profiles.js configuration
- Added HEVC and H.264 profiles
- Included 4K ultra profiles
- Better profile descriptions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (index.html)
- Added GPU load cards in header
- Enhanced updateGPUMonitoring() function
- Added loadChannelResolutions() function
- Added createHeaderGPUCard() function
- Channel resolution display in channel list
- Real-time updates for GPU stats

### Backend Changes (server.js)
- Added detectChannelResolution() function using ffprobe
- Added detectMultipleGPUs() function for multi-GPU detection
- Enhanced GPU monitoring with better error handling
- Added API endpoints for channel resolution and detailed GPU info
- Improved AMD GPU detection for multiple cards

### Docker Configuration
- Enhanced multi-GPU device mappings
- Better privilege handling
- Added AMD-specific devices (/dev/kfd)
- Support for multiple NVIDIA GPUs

## ðŸŽ¯ Features Now Working

1. **Real-time GPU monitoring** - Shows all detected GPUs in header
2. **Channel resolution display** - Each channel shows its resolution and codec
3. **Multi-GPU support** - Tested with 4x AMD RX580 configuration
4. **Docker deployment** - Production-ready with GPU passthrough
5. **Consolidated documentation** - Single README with everything needed

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The system is now fully ready for production deployment with:
- Complete multi-GPU support
- Real-time monitoring
- Docker containerization
- Comprehensive documentation
- Tested configurations

All changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.
